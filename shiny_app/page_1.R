       of all sorts.  According to the World Health Organization, every year close 
       to 800,000 people took their lives by their own hands, and many more 
       attempt but failed (Suicide).  What’s even more concerning is that it is 
       the third leading cause of teenagers (15-19-year-olds), those that make up 
       the next generation of the society (Suicide).  Another thing the article 
       mentions is that almost 80% of the suicide cases occur in middle and low 
       income countries, which brings the factor of financial situation into the 
       equation.  With almost 800,000 lives lost each year and increasing, we 
       need to understand that this is an issue that affects every single living 
       person may it be themselves or their family and friends that put an end to 
       themselves -- not just those of the specific groups mentioned above, as 
       they are just more discriminated against for this issue.  (Note: the term 
       discrimination here follows the definition in Stanford Encyclopedia of 
       Philosophy (Altman).)  The severity of this issue is something that not 
       only all individuals need to act on for themselves and others, but high up 
       the government needs to resolve as well, considering this is something that 
       is increasingly affecting every member of the society, and institutionalized 
       help would allow those who are isolated or in dire need to get help more 
       easily.  Nowadays most countries have suicide hotlines and other facilities,
       yet they don’t necessarily reach to those in need.  In this case we look into
       other factors that might influence suicide in this project, in hope that we 
       can fix other factors to lessen the tension of the issue. "),

  h5("In simple words, people are dying.  In a more complex matter, people are dying
    because they choose to do so themselves, and they do it because other life 
    matters are so difficult to them that even death seems like the easier option.
    These issues that cause people to choose death may be financial matters, 
    emotional problems, relationship issues, or something else -- this matter will
    be further discussed in the project later on."),
  h4("1.3 Why does it matter? "),
  h5("As stated before, this is a growing issue that affects all human beings and 
    must be resolved.  If issues like such that puts matter into life and death 
    can’t be resolved, it becomes a major obstacle for humanity to advance any 
    further and such progression would affect the living quality of every single 
    human being that walks the earth.  Even if one does not care about such
    objective, they should still value the lives of their loved ones more or less.

  h5("The unit of analysis here would be generation groups of either sex of a 
    country of a certain year.  (Note: cases of intersex or more complex matters
    are not included here as they are an extreme minority.  We understand that these
    are extremely vulnerable groups and there are specific LGBTQ+ organizations that
    provides extra support for these individuals.)  For complete list of variables
    of each data entry please refer to Appendix 1: Data Dictionary.  For specific
    variables we’re looking at countries, the gdp per capita of the country, the
    generation (age group), the year and sex of the unit of analysis.  For 
    visualizations we aim to use a scatter plot of year to suicide rates with each
    point being a country as the framework.  From here we can break down the scatter
    plot into multiples by brackets of sex, gdp per capita, or generations.  To put
    the factor of fiscal matters we can substitute the year variable and look at the
    relationship of gdp per capita to suicide rates, and we can break it down into
    multiple plots by brackets of sex, years, or generations.  The final product
    would be simpler than proposed as we hope to present this to the general
    population and to bring awareness to everyone.")
