     the option to change the colors of the observations by generation; and for
     question 3 we could apply the same concept and change the color by sex.  If the
     observation is missing gdp per capita, it would be eliminated from the
     scatterplot of gdp per capita vs suicide rates.  On the sidebar there would be
     options to show only certain sex, certain generations, etc.")
