   to set up the connection with ui.file and server.file, I was really frustrated, 
   plus I wasn't very familiar with the shiny app. No matter how many times I read 
   the textbook or even watched the lecture video, I didn't know how to get this 
   project to start. It took me almost half a day to solve the problem of loading the
   plot. At the behest of a friend, I finally understood the shiny app fundamental. I
   hope that in the rest of the project, our team members can help each other out,
   determined not to procrastinate, in the premise of quality assurance, able to
   complete and successfully deliver this project. Data visualization to me has
   endless knowledge. No matter how you display data, there's no right or wrong
   answer to this, though the audience must know what story you are telling."),

 h5("Harrison: For me this is one of the first large coding project I've done.
    This project felt a lot harder to get by than it should, perhaps due to lacking
    a group member and everyone has to put in extra work.  Nevertheless, the amount
    of experience in coding with R is there regardless.  Having experience in
    SOC225 which is a similar curriculum with assignments through the quarter + 
    a personal project of the same but on a simpler scale, this class surely lived
    up to its name of helping me learn the technical foundations of R.  On a second
    thought I do find it unfortunate that the class simply went through a project
    for the sake of doing a project when there's so much more to discuss -- when
    another class can spend about 50% of it on Cathy O'Neil's book yet we only have
    it as a supplementary textbook and not used for the majority of the class."),

 h5("Kaushal: Through this project, I am gradually understanding how to approach
    the concept of data science, in that the beauty of it is within its vagueness.
    Given a few sets of data, we are able to ask ourselves  meaningful research
    questions and detect trends out of numbers and lines. There were many parts of the
    project I found to be quite difficult at times. Finding and posing research
    questions, obtaining an accurate and useful dataset that matched the criteria and
    manipulating that to answer specific as well as vague questions to name a few. 
    However, this project has been a valuable learning experience for me and now, 
    although I'm not perfect, I know where to start and how to go about the entire 
    process. As a coder, this project has helped me think not only from a logical 
    standpoint but a pattern-detecting and hypothesizing perspective. To write code
    is one thing, but to understand what it is doing and how it is helpful/can
    contribute to more human understanding is what this project is opening my eyes
    to.")
