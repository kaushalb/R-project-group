**Project Description:**
Mental health and suicide have always been prevalent in society with
increasingly more awareness and light shed on it. However, in this project we
attempt unravel the patterns and trends that might correlate suicide rates
in different Countries with focus on financial factors (GDP of the country)
as a unit of analysis and how it may vary across Generations.

We hope to find trends in the data that would provide answers to questions such
as do countries with Higher GDP's have lower suicide rates and how have suicide
rates been different across generations.

We understand that each generation does have to a certain aspect, have a
cultural difference amongst them that is influenced by many aspects including
economy of the country at that era of that generation and are hypothesizing
a connection between all the factors being considered.
